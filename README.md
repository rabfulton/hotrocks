# hotrocks
Android asteroids game using SDL and OpenGLES with native C code.
See /sdl-android-example-master/src/ for the native code. Quite a bit of the code is left over from the the FreeBSD version that I initially wrote, much nicer to develop on... As such references to two player modes and mouse control etc are not relevant in this port. Hopefully someone finds this code usefull in some way.

The game is available on google play:
